# ML-Project-US-Postal-Service-Zip-Code and GISETTE dataset
Applying SVM to Handwritten digits from the processed US Postal Service Zip Code data set.


The data (extracted features of intensity and symmetry) for training and
testing are available at:
• http://www.amlbook.com/data/zip/features.train


• http://www.amlbook.com/data/zip/features.test


Part 1: Applied soft-margin SVM to handwritten digits.


Part 2:Trained and reported accuracy considering linear, polynomial kernel and radial basis function kernel. Compared all three w.r.t accuracy, Q and C values.

**GISETTE**
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Gisette) is a handwritten digit recognition problem.


Standard run: Use all the 6000 training samples from the training set to train the model, and test over all test instances, using the linear kernel.

Also applied Kernal variations like polynomial kernel and radial basis function kernel.
